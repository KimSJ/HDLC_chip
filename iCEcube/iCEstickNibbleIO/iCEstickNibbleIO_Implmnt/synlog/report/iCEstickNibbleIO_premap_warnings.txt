@W: MT529 :"c:\users\kim\documents\development\hdls\hdlc_chip\arduinointerface.vhd":60:27:60:29|Found inferred clock arduinointerface|clk which controls 19 sequential elements including q[7:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
